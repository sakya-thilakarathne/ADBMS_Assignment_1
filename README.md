Task 1: Setting Up Microservices 
1. Choose a programming language and framework for implementing microservices
(e.g., Node.js with Express, Spring Boot, Django, etc.).
2. Create three separate microservices (Microservice A, B, and C), each representing a
different functionality.
a. Microservice A - User Management
b. Microservice B - Order Placement
c. Microservice C - Inventory Management
3. Implement RESTful APIs for each microservice, including endpoints for basic CRUD
operations.
a. Microservice A - Create, Update, View, Delete Users
b. Microservice B - Create, Update, View, Delete Orders
c. Microservice C - Create, Update, View, Delete Products
Task 2: Database Integration 
1. Select three different types of databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, Microsoft SQL
Server, DynamoDB) for each microservice.
2. Configure the databases for each microservice and establish connections.
3. Implement database operations for each microservice's functionality (Create, View,
Update, Delete).
Task 3: Microservices Communication 
● Implement communication mechanisms between the microservices.
● Ensure that microservices can exchange relevant data and maintain consistency
across their interactions.
